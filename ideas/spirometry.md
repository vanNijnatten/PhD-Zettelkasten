**FEV<sub>1</sub>**
Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second.
Can be measured pre- and post-bronchodilator. 
**Normalised:** FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted. There are multiple ways to calculate this from FEV<sub>1</sub> in liters. We use GLI-2012 (Quanjer), not NHANES III (Hankinson). Takes into account ethnicity, gender, height and age.

**FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC**
Also known as Tiffeneau-Index. This is the fraction of how much of your lung capacity are able to exhale in 1 second. Normal values are between 0.7 and 0.8.
Used for COPD diagnosis (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC < 0.7)

**RV**
Residual Volume
**Normalised:** RV % predicted.

**TLC**
Total Lung Capacity
**Normalised:** TLC % predicted.

**Diffusion DLCO**
Diffusion capacity (DLCO also known as transfer factor)
**Normalised:** Diffusion DLCO % predicted.

**Diffusion KCO**
The transfer coefficient (KCO) is DLCOc corrected for alveolar volume.
**Normalised:** Diffusion KCO % predicted.
