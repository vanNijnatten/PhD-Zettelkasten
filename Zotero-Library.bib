  abstract = {The complex cellular heterogeneity of the lung poses a unique challenge to researchers in the field. While the use of bulk RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology in systems biology, the technique necessarily averages out individual contributions to the overall transcriptional landscape of a tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a robust, unbiased survey of the transcriptome comparable to bulk RNA sequencing while preserving information on cellular heterogeneity. In just a few years since this technology was developed, scRNA-seq has already been adopted widely in respiratory research and has contributed to impressive advancements such as the discoveries of the pulmonary ionocyte and of a profibrotic macrophage population in pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we discuss general technical considerations when considering the use of scRNA-seq and examine how leading investigators have applied the technology to gain novel insights into respiratory biology, from development to disease. In addition, we discuss the evolution of single-cell technologies with a focus on spatial and multi-omics approaches that promise to drive continued innovation in respiratory research.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Tissues are complex systems of interacting cell types. Knowing cell-type proportions in a tissue is very important to identify which cells or cell types are targeted by a disease or perturbation. When measuring such responses using RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq masks cellular heterogeneity. Hence, several computational methods have been proposed to infer cell-type proportions from bulk RNA samples. Their performance with noisy reference profiles highly depends on the set of genes undergoing deconvolution. These genes are often selected based on prior knowledge or a single-criterion test that might not be useful to dissect closely correlated cell types. In this work, we introduce             AutoGeneS             , a tool that automatically extracts informative genes and reveals the cellular heterogeneity of bulk RNA samples. AutoGeneS requires no prior knowledge about marker genes and selects genes by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria: minimizing the correlation and maximizing the distance between cell types. It can be applied to reference profiles from various sources like single-cell experiments or sorted cell populations. Results from human samples of peripheral blood illustrate that AutoGeneS outperforms other methods. Our results also highlight the impact of our approach on analyzing bulk RNA samples with noisy single-cell reference profiles and closely correlated cell types. Ground truth cell proportions analyzed by flow cytometry confirmed the accuracy of the predictions of AutoGeneS in identifying cell-type proportions. AutoGeneS is available for use via a standalone Python package (             https://github.com/theislab/AutoGeneS             ).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many computational methods have been developed to infer cell type proportions from bulk transcriptomics data. However, an evaluation of the impact of data transformation, pre-processing, marker selection, cell type composition and choice of methodology on the deconvolution results is still lacking. Using five single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, we generate pseudo-bulk mixtures to evaluate the combined impact of these factors. Both bulk deconvolution methodologies and those that use scRNA-seq data as reference perform best when applied to data in linear scale and the choice of normalization has a dramatic impact on some, but not all methods. Overall, methods that use scRNA-seq data have comparable performance to the best performing bulk methods whereas semi-supervised approaches show higher error values. Moreover, failure to include cell types in the reference that are present in a mixture leads to substantially worse results, regardless of the previous choices. Altogether, we evaluate the combined impact of factors affecting the deconvolution task across different datasets and propose general guidelines to maximize its performance.},

  abstract = {Deep learning takes on protein folding                            In 1972, Anfinsen won a Nobel prize for demonstrating a connection between a protein’s amino acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure. Since 1994, scientists have competed in the biannual Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) protein-folding challenge. Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind’s Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek               et al               . explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. The method, RoseTTA fold, can solve challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy modeling problems and generate accurate models of protein-protein complexes. —VV                        ,              Protein structure modeling enables the rapid solution of protein structures and provides insights into function.           ,              DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been extensively studied, especially in Western Europe and North America. Few of these data are directly comparable because of differences between the surveys regarding composition of study populations, diagnostic criteria of the disease and definitions of the risk factors. Few community studies have examined phenotypes of COPD and included other ways of characterising the disease beyond that of spirometry. The objective of the present Task Force report is to present recommendations for the performance of general population studies in COPD in order to facilitate comparable and valid estimates on COPD prevalence by various risk factors. Diagnostic criteria in epidemiological settings, and standardised methods to examine the disease and its potential risk factors are discussed. The paper also offers practical advice for planning and performing an epidemiological study on COPD. The main message of the paper is that thorough planning is worth half the study. It is crucial to stick to standardised methods and good quality control during sampling. We recommend collecting biological markers, depending on the specific objectives of the study. Finally, studies of COPD in the population at large should assess various phenotypes of the disease.},

  abstract = {COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) together represent a considerable unmet medical need, and advances in their treatment lag well behind those of other chronic conditions. Both diseases involve maladaptive repair mechanisms leading to progressive and irreversible damage. However, our understanding of the complex underlying disease mechanisms is incomplete; with current diagnostic approaches, COPD and IPF are often discovered at an advanced stage and existing definitions of COPD and IPF can be misleading. To halt or reverse disease progression and achieve lung regeneration, there is a need for earlier identification and treatment of these diseases. A precision medicine approach to treatment is also important, involving the recognition of disease subtypes, or endotypes, according to underlying disease mechanisms, rather than the current “one-size-fits-all” approach. This review is based on discussions at a meeting involving 38 leading global experts in chronic lung disease mechanisms, and describes advances in the understanding of the pathology and molecular mechanisms of COPD and IPF to identify potential targets for reversing disease degeneration and promoting tissue repair and lung regeneration. We also discuss limitations of existing disease measures, technical advances in understanding disease pathology, and novel methods for targeted drug delivery.},

  abstract = {Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT or AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor (PI) which, when present at low levels, can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease in both children and adults. Several mutations within the SERPINA1 gene have been found to cause this deficiency. The most common variants are PI*Z and PI*S, each caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We describe a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the rapid genotyping of these polymorphisms. DNA was extracted from fourteen EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples using the Qiagen EZ1 blood extraction kit. SNP genotyping was performed using primer/probe sets purchased from Applied Biosystems. These were evaluated for performance and assay conditions on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST System. The genotypes of these samples were compared with their phenotype results from isoelectric focusing assays, which were performed by an independent reference laboratory. In addition, twenty samples that were previously genotyped at another laboratory were obtained for accuracy studies. Thirty-four samples were tested; five genotypes were represented and the assay was able to discriminate these successfully. Only one genotype could not be correlated with its phenotype result, as the phenotype was reported as an "unidentified allele". All other genotyping results were concordant with previously determined genotypes and phenotypes. We describe a rapid real time PCR assay that is suitable for clinical use in genotyping AAT alleles and which can be used as the initial step in A1AT testing algorithms.},

The role of               NRF2               in pulmonary neoplasia, a diverse disease for which few biomarkers exist, is complicated and appears to depend on several main factors including the existence of activating mutations in               NRF2               and/or loss of function mutations in               KEAP1               and the stage of carcinogenesis studied, particularly in the mouse models tested. Therapeutic strategies for lung cancer targeting               NRF2               have observed mixed results, both anti- and protumorigenic effects; however, these differences seem to reflect the mutation status of               NRF2               or               KEAP1               .

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence, in particular in the elderly. COPD is characterised by abnormal tissue repair resulting in (small) airways disease and emphysema. There is accumulating evidence that ageing hallmarks are prominent features of COPD. These ageing hallmarks have been described in different subsets of COPD patients, in different lung compartments and also in a variety of cell types, and thus might contribute to different COPD phenotypes. A better understanding of the main differences and similarities between normal lung ageing and the pathology of COPD may improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving COPD pathology, in particular in those patients that develop the most severe form of COPD at a relatively young age,               i.e.               severe early-onset COPD patients.                          In this review, after introducing the main concepts of lung ageing and COPD pathology, we focus on the role of (abnormal) ageing in lung remodelling and repair in COPD. We discuss the current evidence for the involvement of ageing hallmarks in these pathological features of COPD. We also highlight potential novel treatment strategies and opportunities for future research based on our current knowledge of abnormal lung ageing in COPD.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by nonreversible proximal bronchial obstruction leading to major respiratory disability. However, patient phenotypes better capture the heterogeneously reported complaints and symptoms of COPD. Recent studies provided evidence that classical bronchial obstruction does not properly reflect respiratory disability, and symptoms now form the new paradigm for assessment of disease severity and guidance of therapeutic strategies. The aim of this review was to explore pathways addressing COPD pathogenesis beyond proximal bronchial obstruction and to highlight innovative and promising tools for phenotyping and bedside assessment.             Distal small airways imaging allows quantitative characterisation of emphysema and functional air trapping. Micro-computed tomography and parametric response mapping suggest small airways disease precedes emphysema destruction. Small airways can be assessed functionally using nitrogen washout, probing ventilation at conductive or acinar levels, and forced oscillation technique. These tests may better correlate with respiratory symptoms and may well capture bronchodilation effects beyond proximal obstruction.             Knowledge of inflammation-based processes has not provided well-identified targets so far, and eosinophils probably play a minor role. Adaptative immunity or specific small airways secretory protein may provide new therapeutic targets. Pulmonary vasculature is involved in emphysema through capillary loss, microvascular lesions or hypoxia-induced remodelling, thereby impacting respiratory disability.},

  abstract = {α               1               -antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary disorder associated with a risk of developing liver disease and pulmonary emphysema, and other chronic respiratory disorders (mainly asthma and bronchiectasis); Z variant is the commonest deficient variant of AAT. Determining AAT concentration in serum or plasma and identifying allelic variants by phenotyping or genotyping are fundamental in the diagnosis of AATD. Initial evaluation and annual follow-up measurement of lung function, including post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1\hspace{0.25em}s and gas transfer inform on disease progression. Lung densitometry is the most sensitive measure of emphysema progression, but must not be use in the follow-up of patients in routine clinical practice. The exogenous administration of purified human serum-derived AAT is the only approved specific treatment for AATD in PiZZ. AAT augmentation therapy is not recommended in PiSZ, PiMZ or current smokers of any protein phenotype, or in patients with hepatic disease. Lung volume reduction and endoscopic bronchial valve placement are useful in selected patients, whereas the survival benefit of lung transplant is unclear. There are several new lines of research in AATD to improve the diagnosis and evaluation of the response to therapy and to develop genetic and regenerative therapies and other treatments.},

  abstract = {Rationale               Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Studies have primarily assessed the relationship between smoking on COPD risk focusing on summary measures, like smoking status.                                         Objective               Develop a COPD risk prediction model incorporating individual time-varying smoking exposures.                                         Methods               The Nurses’ Health Study (N = 86,711) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 39,817) data was used to develop a COPD risk prediction model. Data was randomly split in 50–50 samples for model building and validation. Cox regression with time-varying covariates was used to assess the association between smoking duration, intensity and year-since-quit and self-reported COPD diagnosis incidence. We evaluated the model calibration as well as discriminatory accuracy via the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). We computed 6-year risk of COPD incidence given various individual smoking scenarios.                                         Results               Smoking duration, year-since-quit (if former smokers), sex, and interaction of sex and smoking duration are significantly associated with the incidence of diagnosed COPD. The model that incorporated time-varying smoking variables yielded higher AUCs compared to models using only pack-years. The AUCs for the model were 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.74–0.86) and 0.73 (95\% CI: 0.70–0.77) for males and females, respectively.                                         Conclusions               Utilizing detailed smoking pattern information, the model predicts COPD risk with better accuracy than models based on only smoking summary measures. It might serve as a tool for early detection programs by identifying individuals at high-risk for COPD.},

Classical identification criteria are applied and integrated into our Bayesian procedure to generate models that are stable and clearly interpretable. A Monte Carlo study confirms the validity of the approach. The method is used to produce interpretable low dimensional aggregates from a high dimensional set of psychological measurements.},

  abstract = {Significance                            The photoreceptor outer segments are primary cilia, modified for phototransduction by incorporation of stacked opsin-loaded membrane disks that are continuously regenerated. This process is disrupted in several types of inherited retinal dystrophy, but the driving force remained unclear. We show that C2orf71/PCARE (photoreceptor cilium actin regulator), associated with inherited retinal dystrophy subtype RP54, efficiently recruits the Arp2/3 complex activator WASF3 to the cilium. This activates an actin dynamics-driven expansion of the ciliary tip, resembling membrane evagination in lamellipodia formation. Colocalization of this actin dynamics module to the base of the outer segments, and absence thereof in               Pcare                                −/−                              mice, suggests PCARE-regulated actin dynamics as a critical process in outer segment disk formation.                        ,                             The outer segments (OS) of rod and cone photoreceptor cells are specialized sensory cilia that contain hundreds of opsin-loaded stacked membrane disks that enable phototransduction. The biogenesis of these disks is initiated at the OS base, but the driving force has been debated. Here, we studied the function of the protein encoded by the photoreceptor-specific gene               C2orf71               , which is mutated in inherited retinal dystrophy (RP54). We demonstrate that C2orf71/PCARE (photoreceptor cilium actin regulator) can interact with the Arp2/3 complex activator WASF3, and efficiently recruits it to the primary cilium. Ectopic coexpression of PCARE and WASF3 in ciliated cells results in the remarkable expansion of the ciliary tip. This process was disrupted by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based down-regulation of an actin regulator, by pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization, and by the expression of PCARE harboring a retinal dystrophy-associated missense mutation. Using human retinal organoids and mouse retina, we observed that a similar actin dynamics-driven process is operational at the base of the photoreceptor OS where the PCARE module and actin colocalize, but which is abrogated in               Pcare                                −/−                              mice. The observation that several proteins involved in retinal ciliopathies are translocated to these expansions renders it a potential common denominator in the pathomechanisms of these hereditary disorders. Together, our work suggests that PCARE is an actin-associated protein that interacts with WASF3 to regulate the actin-driven expansion of the ciliary membrane at the initiation of new outer segment disk formation.},

  abstract = {Airway remodelling is a well-established feature in asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), secondary to chronic airway inflammation. The structural changes found on pathological examination of remodelled airway wall have been shown to display similarities but also differences. Computed tomography (CT) is today a remarkable tool to assess airway wall morphology               in vivo               since submillimetric acquisitions over the whole lung volume could be obtained allowing 3D evaluation. Recently, CT-derived indices extracted from CT images have been described and are thought to assess airway remodelling. This may help understand the complex mechanism underlying the remodelling process, which is still not fully understood. This paper summarizes the various methods described to quantify airway remodelling in asthma and COPD using CT, and similarities and differences between both diseases will be emphasized.},

While studies have shown that smoking alters bronchial epithelial function and morphology, its precise effects on specific cell types and overall tissue composition are unclear. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile bronchial epithelial cells from six never and six current smokers. Unsupervised analyses led to the characterization of a set of toxin metabolism genes that localized to smoker ciliated cells, tissue remodeling associated with a loss of club cells and extensive goblet cell hyperplasia, and a previously unidentified peri-goblet epithelial subpopulation in smokers who expressed a marker of bronchial premalignant lesions. Our data demonstrate that smoke exposure drives a complex landscape of cellular alterations that may prime the human bronchial epithelium for disease.},

  abstract = {The aim was to investigate whether microRNA (miRNA) expression is modulated by inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment             We performed genome-wide miRNA analysis on bronchial biopsies of 69 moderate/severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients at baseline and after 6- and 30-month treatment with the ICS fluticasone propionate or placebo. The effect of ICS on miRNA expression was validated in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cultures, and functional studies were conducted in BEAS-2B cells. MiRNAs affected by ICS and their predicted targets were compared to an independent miRNA dataset of bronchial brushings from COPD patients and healthy controls.                            Treatment with ICS for both 6 and 30 months significantly altered the expression of four miRNAs, including miR-320d, which was increased during ICS treatment compared with placebo. The ICS-induced increase of miR-320d was confirmed in primary airway epithelial cells. MiR-320d negatively correlated targets were enriched for pro-inflammatory genes and were increased in the bronchial brushes of patients with lower lung function in the independent dataset. Overexpression of miR-320d in BEAS-2B cells dampened cigarette smoke extract-induced pro-inflammatory activity               via               inhibition of nuclear factor-κB.                          Collectively, we identified miR-320d as a novel mediator of ICS, regulating the pro-inflammatory response of the airway epithelium.},

Methods Prospective 3-month cohort study of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who were provided a portable electronic inhaler sensor to monitor daily SABA use. Subjects wore a pedometer for 3 seven-day periods and were asked to complete a daily diary of symptoms and inhaler use. Overuse was defined as {$>$}8 actuations of their SABA per day while clinically stable. Results Among 32 participants, 15 overused their SABA inhaler at least once (mean 8.6~±~5.0 puffs/day), and 6 overused their inhaler more than 50\% of monitored days. Compared to those with no overuse, overusers had greater dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale: 2.7 vs. 1.9, p~=~0.02), were more likely to use home oxygen (67\% vs. 29\%, p~=~0.04), and were more likely to be on maximal inhaled therapy (long-acting beta-agonist, long-acting antimuscarinic agent, and an inhaled steroid: 40\% vs. 6\%, p~=~0.03), and most had completed pulmonary rehabilitation (67\% vs. 0\%, p~{$<~$}0.001). However, 27\% of overusers of SABA were not on guideline-concordant COPD therapy. Conclusions Overuse of SABA was common and associated with increased disease severity and symptoms, even though overusers were on more COPD-related inhalers and more had completed pulmonary rehabilitation. More research is needed to understand factors associated with inhaler overuse and how to improve correct inhaler use.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2–7), particularly those in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3′UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the “offset 6mer,” to be detected. In total, {$>$}45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3′UTRs are conserved above background levels, and {$>$}60\% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3′ end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2\% of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (               P               CT               ) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3′-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the               P               CT               for each site and each predicted target.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the USA, and represents a major health, social and economic burden. COPD is under- diagnosed and often misdiagnosed, which likely contributes to the continuing increases in the prevalence, morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. This is unfortunate because whereas COPD cannot be cured, it can be treated effectively, particularly during the earlier stages of the disease. Evidence-based guidelines, developed to assist in the prevention, diagnosis and management of COPD, are available to healthcare professionals interested in learning more about COPD. These guidelines are updated and revised on a regular basis to reflect recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of and treatments available for COPD. Nevertheless, primary-care physicians have reported a lack of awareness of the fundamental concepts underpinning the optimal treatment and management of COPD presented in the guidelines. Thus, the objective of this arti- cle is to summarise key physiologic, diagnostic and management concepts provided in the most recent update of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Dis- ease (GOLD) guidelines, which were published in November 2006.},

  abstract = {Finding the similarities and differences between groups of datasets is a fundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to find the characteristics of each group. However, existing DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that most differentiate groups. This paper presents an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, the interactive visualization interface facilitates interpretation and refinement of the ULCA results. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of this framework.},

  abstract = {Diagnosing primary mitochondrial diseases is challenging in clinical practice. Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.                                         Results               To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.                                         Conclusions                                GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at                 http://www.bioconductor.org                 .},

  abstract = {The approach, technologies, methodologies, implementation and methods done so far in characterizing and profiling transcriptomes of RNA-Seq are described. RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a newly born tool that has revolutionized the post-genomic era. The data produced by RNA-Seq, sequencing technologies and use of bioinformatics are exploding rapidly. In recent years, RNA-Seq has been the method of choice for profiling dynamic transcriptome taking advantage of high throughput sequencing technologies. RNA-Seq studies have shown the transcriptome magnitude, notion and complexity. From 2008, as its introduction year, the relevant reports on RNA-Seq have been multiplied by more than 2822 times just in 6 years. RNA-Seq also contributes a more accurate gene expression and transcript isoform estimation than other methods. Furthermore, some of the potential applications for RNA-Seq cannot be conducted by other methods and as yet are unique to RNA-Seq. As RNA-Seq approaches increase in speed and decrease in cost, more distinct researches are applied and become more common and accurate. RNA-Seq is a cross and interdisciplinary method that interconnects biology to other scientific topics. This article describes RNA-Seq approach, technologies, methodologies, implementation and methods done so far in characterizing and profiling transcriptomes. RESUMEN En los ultimos anos, la tecnica RNA-Seq~ ha tenido un desarrollo acelerado y se ha convertido en el metodo de eleccion para el estudio y la caracterizacion de los transcriptomas dinamicos, aprovechando las tecnologias de secuenciacion de alto rendimiento. Estudios aplicando RNA-Seq han mostrado la magnitud, nocion y complejidad del transcripotma. A partir de 2008, ano de introduccion de la tecnica, los estudios con RNA-Seq se han multiplicados por mas de 2822 veces solo en 6 anos. Al compararse con otros metodos, los estudios empleando RNA-Seq contribuyen a una estimacion mas precisa de la expresion genica y de las isoformas de los transcriptos. Ademas, algunas de las aplicaciones potenciales de RNA-Seq no se pueden llevar a cabo con otros metodos. El uso de RNA-Seq aumenta la velocidad de obtencion de informacion y disminuye los costos, logrando con su uso, que investigaciones diversas se vuelvan mas frecuentes y precisas. RNA-Seq es un metodo interdisciplinario que interconecta la biologia a otros temas cientificos. En este articulo se describe el planteamiento de la tecnologia RNA-Seq, metodologias y los metodos realizados en la caracterizacion de transcriptomas.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort               1–4               , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined               5               , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences               6,7               . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’               8               —has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years               9               . Despite recent progress               10–14               , existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)               15               , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the lung plays several important roles in lung function, as it offers a low resistant pathway that allows the exchange of gases, provides compressive strength and elasticity that supports the fragile alveolar–capillary intersection, controls the binding of cells with growth factors and cell surface receptors and acts as a buffer against retention of water.             COPD is a chronic inflammatory respiratory condition, characterised by various conditions that result in progressive airflow limitation. At any stage in the course of the disease, acute exacerbations of COPD may occur and lead to accelerated deterioration of pulmonary function. A key factor of COPD is airway remodelling, which refers to the serious alterations of the ECM affecting airway wall thickness, resistance and elasticity. Various studies have shown that serum biomarkers of ECM turnover are significantly associated with disease severity in patients with COPD and may serve as potential targets to control airway inflammation and remodelling in COPD. Unravelling the complete molecular composition of the ECM in the diseased lungs will help to identify novel biomarkers for disease progression and therapy.},

Inhibitors of PDE5A such as sildenafil are widely used to treat erectile dysfunction, but growing evidence supports important roles for the enzyme in both the vasculature and heart. In disorders such as cardiac failure, PDE5A upregulation may contribute to a decline in cGMP and protein kinase G signaling, exacerbating dysfunction. PDE5A plays an important role in the pulmonary vasculature where its inhibition benefits patients with pulmonary hypertension. In the heart, PDE5A signaling appears compartmentalized, and its inhibition is cardioprotective against ischemia-reperfusion and antracycline toxicity, blunts acute adrenergic contractile stimulation, and can suppress chronic hypertrophy and dysfunction attributable to pressure-overload. In this review, we discuss the molecular biology, pharmacology, and physiology of PDE5A, mechanisms of vascular and cardiac regulation, and recent evidence supporting the utility of selective PDE5A inhibition for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.},

Secondary end-points included acute care hospitalisation days, BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise) index and exacerbations. Safety end-points included adverse events and deaths. For the 157 (disease management) and 162 (usual management) patients eligible for ITT analyses, all-cause hospitalisation days per year (mean±sd) were 17.4±35.4 and 22.6±41.8, respectively (mean difference −5.3, 95\% CI −13.7 to −3.1; p=0.16). The disease management group had fewer per-protocol acute care hospitalisation days per year (p=0.047), a lower BODE index (p=0.01) and a lower mortality rate (1.9\% versus 14.2\%; p{$<$}0.001), with no difference in exacerbation frequency. Patient profiles and hospitalisation practices varied substantially across countries. The COMET disease management intervention did not significantly reduce unplanned all-cause hospitalisation days, but reduced acute care hospitalisation days and mortality in severe COPD patients.

Compared to previous Sanger sequencing- and microarray-based methods, RNA-Seq provides far higher coverage and greater resolution of the dynamic nature of the transcriptome. Beyond quantifying gene expression, the data generated by RNA-Seq facilitate the discovery of novel transcripts, identification of alternatively spliced genes, and detection of allele-specific expression. Recent advances in the RNA-Seq workflow, from sample preparation to library construction to data analysis, have enabled researchers to further elucidate the functional complexity of the transcription. In addition to polyadenylated messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, RNA-Seq can be applied to investigate different populations of RNA, including total RNA, pre-mRNA, and noncoding RNA, such as microRNA and long ncRNA. This article provides an introduction to RNA-Seq methods, including applications, experimental design, and technical challenges.},

However, the available protocols for construction of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries are expensive and/or difficult to scale for high-throughput applications. Also, most protocols require isolated total RNA as a starting point. We provide a cost-effective RNA-Seq library synthesis protocol that is fast, starts with tissue, and is high-throughput from tissue to synthesized library. We have also designed and report a set of 96 unique barcodes for library adapters that are amenable to high-throughput sequencing by a large combination of multiplexing strategies. Our developed protocol has more power to detect differentially expressed genes when compared to the standard Illumina protocol, probably owing to less technical variation amongst replicates. We also address the problem of gene-length biases affecting differential gene expression calls and demonstrate that such biases can be efficiently minimized during mRNA isolation for library preparation.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease driven by diverse immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms. Objectives: Using transcriptomic profiling of airway tissues, we sought to define the molecular phenotypes of severe asthma. Methods: The transcriptome derived from bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushings of 107 subjects with moderate to severe asthma were annotated by gene set variation analysis using 42 gene signatures relevant to asthma, inflammation, and immune function. Topological data analysis of clinical and histologic data was performed to derive clusters, and the nearest shrunken centroid algorithm was used for signature refinement. Measurements and Main Results: Nine gene set variation analysis signatures expressed in bronchial biopsies and airway epithelial brushings distinguished two distinct asthma subtypes associated with high expression of T-helper cell type 2 cytokines and lack of corticosteroid response (group 1 and group 3). Group 1 had the highest submucosal eosinophils, as well as high fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, exacerbation rates, and oral corticosteroid use, whereas group 3 patients showed the highest levels of sputum eosinophils and had a high body mass index. In contrast, group 2 and group 4 patients had an 86\% and 64\% probability, respectively, of having noneosinophilic inflammation. Using machine learning tools, we describe an inference scheme using the currently available inflammatory biomarkers sputum eosinophilia and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, along with oral corticosteroid use, that could predict the subtypes of gene expression within bronchial biopsies and epithelial cells with good sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of a transcriptomics-driven approach to phenotyping that segments patients who may benefit the most from specific agents that target T-helper cell type 2–mediated inflammation and/or corticosteroid insensitivity.},

We studied 7,764 men and women for 5 yrs. The subjects were grouped according to self-reported smoking habits during the observation period. We found that persistent cigarette smoking, in particular heavy smoking, accelerated the decline in FEV1. In 310 subjects who quitted smoking during the observation period, the decline of FEV1 was less pronounced than the decline observed in persistent smokers. In subjects younger than 55 yrs of age, smoking reduction was associated with a less pronounced FEV1 decline, while in the elderly subjects smoking reduction had no effect on the FEV1 decline. An increase in the number of cigarettes smoked was generally associated with a more rapid decline of FEV1, while the beginning of smoking during the 5 yrs of observation did not seem to influence the decline of FEV1. We conclude that smoking cessation or reduction may lead to a demonstrable beneficial effect on the FEV1 decline within a few years.},

  abstract = {Aim: We evaluated five~methods for detecting differentially methylated regions (DMRs): DMRcate, comb-p, seqlm, GlobalP and dmrff. Materials \& methods: We used a simulation study and real data analysis to evaluate performance. Additionally, we evaluated the use of an ancestry-matched reference cohort to estimate correlations between CpG sites in cord blood. Results: Several methods had inflated Type I error, which increased at more stringent significant levels. In power simulations with 1–2 causal CpG sites with the same direction of effect, dmrff was consistently among the most powerful methods. Conclusion: This study illustrates the need for more thorough simulation studies when evaluating novel methods. More work must be done to develop methods with well-controlled Type I error that do not require individual-level data.},

Algorithmic search is commonly used for finding such designs, but this approach becomes ineffective for large problems. Theoretical construction of maximin distance designs is challenging; some results have been obtained recently, often using highly specialized techniques. This article presents an easy-to-use method for constructing maximin distance designs. The method is versatile as it works with any distance measure. The basic idea is to construct large designs from small designs, and the method is effective because the quality of large designs is guaranteed by that of small designs, as evaluated by the maximin distance criterion.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the third most common cause of global mortality. Acute exacerbations of COPD frequently necessitate hospital admission to enable more intensive therapy, incurring significant healthcare costs. COPD exacerbations are also associated with accelerated lung function decline and increased risk of mortality. Until recently, bacterial pathogens were believed to be responsible for the majority of disease exacerbations. However, with the advent of culture-independent molecular diagnostic techniques it is now estimated that viruses are detected during half of all COPD exacerbations and are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza are the most commonly detected viruses during exacerbation. The role of persistent viral infection (adenovirus) has also been postulated as a potential pathogenic mechanism in COPD. Viral pathogens may play an important role in driving COPD progression by acting as triggers for exacerbation and subsequent lung function decline whilst the role of chronic viral infection remains a plausible hypothesis that requires further evaluation. There are currently no effective antiviral strategies for patients with COPD. Herein, we focus on the current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of respiratory viral infection in COPD.},

The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

  abstract = {Most chronic and acute lung diseases have no cure, leaving lung transplantation as the only option. Recent work has improved our understanding of the endogenous regenerative capacity of the lung and has helped identification of different progenitor cell populations, as well as exploration into inducing endogenous regeneration through pharmaceutical or biological therapies. Additionally, alternative approaches that aim at replacing lung progenitor cells and their progeny through cell therapy, or whole lung tissue through bioengineering approaches, have gained increasing attention. Although impressive progress has been made, efforts at regenerating functional lung tissue are still ineffective. Chronic and acute lung diseases are most prevalent in the elderly and alterations in progenitor cells with ageing, along with an increased inflammatory milieu, present major roadblocks for regeneration. Multiple cellular mechanisms, such as cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction, are aberrantly regulated in the aged and diseased lung, which impairs regeneration. Existing as well as new human               in vitro               models are being developed, improved and adapted in order to study potential mechanisms of lung regeneration in different contexts. This review summarises recent advances in understanding endogenous as well as exogenous regeneration and the development of               in vitro               models for studying regenerative mechanisms.},

Viegi Number 1 in this Series ⇓In preparing the joint statements on lung function testing for the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), it was agreed by the working party that the format of the statements should be modified so that they were easier to use by both technical and clinical staff. This statement contains details about procedures that are common for many methods of lung function testing and, hence, are presented on their own. A list of abbreviations used in all the documents is also included as part of this statement. All terms and abbreviations used here are based on a report of the American College of Chest Physicians/ATS Joint Committee on Pulmonary Nomenclature 1. The metrology definitions agreed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) are recommended 2 and some important terms are defined as follows. Accuracy is the closeness of agreement between the result of a measurement and the conventional true value. Repeatability is the closeness of agreement between the results of successive measurements of the same item carried out, subject to all of the following conditions: same method, same observer, same instrument, same location, same condition of use, and repeated over a short space of time. In previous documents, the term reproducibility was used in this context, and this represents a change towards bringing this document in line with the ISO. Reproducibility is the closeness of agreement of the results of successive measurements of the same item where the individual measurements are carried out with changed conditions, such as: method of measurement, observer, instrument, location, conditions of use, and time. Thus, if a technician tests a subject several times, this is looking at the …},

We present a database of {$>$}270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5\% comprise long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain 15-17\% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype-phenotype map than previously anticipated.},

The GOLD documents endeavor to incorporate latest evidence and expert consensus and are intended for use as “strategy documents” for implementation of effective care for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) on a global level. The GOLD 2018 report defines COPD as a “common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases,” with the criteria of “persistent respiratory symptoms” being a new and controversial inclusion since 2017. With the availability of newer pharmacotherapy options, treatment recommendations are made on the basis of a review of the latest literature and directed by symptom burden and health care utilization. Apart from the change in definition, a major shift in the recommen- dations is the exclusion of severity of airflow limitation as one of the major factors in guiding therapy. We review the salient features of the GOLD 2018 document and provide commentary on features that merit further discussion based on our clinical experience and practice as well as literature review current as of February 2018.},

  abstract = {Serine peptidase inhibitor, clade B, member 10 (SERPINB10) expression is increased in IL-13-stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells and in a murine model of allergic airway inflammation. However, the role of SERPINB10 in asthma remains unknown. We examined the association between epithelial SERPINB10 expression and airway eosinophilia in subjects with asthma and the role of Serpinb10 in allergic airway inflammation in an animal model. Epithelial SERPINB10 mRNA and protein expression were markedly increased in subjects with asthma (n = 60) compared with healthy controls (n = 25). Epithelial SERPINB10 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and three parameters reflecting airway eosinophilia including the percentage of sputum eosinophils, the number of eosinophils in bronchial submucosa, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in subjects with asthma. Moreover, epithelial SERPINB10 expression was strongly correlated with the epithelial gene signature (CLCA1, POSTN, and SERPINB2) for type 2 status. In normal human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface, knockdown of SERPINB10 suppressed IL-13-stimulated periostin (encoded by POSTN) and CCL26 (eotaxin-3) expression by inhibiting the activation of p38 MAPK. Epithelial CCL26 mRNA levels were correlated with SERPINB10 expression in subjects with asthma. Airway knockdown of Serpinb10 alleviated AHR, airway eosinophilia and the expression of periostin and Ccl26 in a murine model of allergic airway disease. Taken together, epithelial SERPINB10 is a novel marker for airway eosinophilia in asthma. Epithelial SERPINB10 contributes to allergic airway eosinophilic inflammation, at least in part, by regulating the expression of periostin and CCL26.},

  abstract = {The lower airways of asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients can be colonized by bacteria, mainly Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, the role of lower airway bacteria in stable and exacerbated COPD has not been well defined. To determine the importance of lower airway bacterial infection in COPD we studied 40 outpatients with stable COPD (Group A: age 61.1 +/- 9.9 yr; [mean +/- SD]; FEV1/FVC 51.7 +/- 12.5) and 29 outpatients with exacerbated COPD (Group B: age 63.4, SD 9.0 yr; FEV1/FVC 52.0, SD 9.6), using the protected specimen brush (PSB) for microbiology sampling. Group A consisted of outpatients with stable COPD having normal or near-normal chest X-rays, with clinical indications for performing fiber-bronchoscopy (pulmonary nodule, remote hemoptysis); Group B consisted of patients with exacerbated COPD who voluntarily accepted lower airway microbiology sampling. To avoid contamination by upper airway flora the PSB was used for bacterial sampling in all the cases and concentrations {$>$} or = 1,000 colony-forming units/milliliter (CFU/ml) were considered positive. Results were as follows: Group A: Lung function data in outpatients with stable COPD were lower than the reference values for this population (FVC 2.97 +/- 1.02 L, FVC\% 71.4 +/- 22.4, FEV1 1.59 +/- 0.79 L, FEV1\% 51.2 +/- 23.0). Positive PSB cultures were obtained in 10 of 40 cases (25\%), mainly of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Two of 40 cases had positive cultures at concentrations {$>$} or = 10,000 CFU/ml (5.0\%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

While these drafts and the updates that followed effectively covered the euchromatic fraction of the genome, the heterochromatin and many other complex regions were left unfinished or erroneous. Addressing this remaining 8\% of the genome, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium has finished the first truly complete 3.055 billion base pair (bp) sequence of a human genome, representing the largest improvement to the human reference genome since its initial release. The new T2T-CHM13 reference includes gapless assemblies for all 22 autosomes plus Chromosome X, corrects numerous errors, and introduces nearly 200 million bp of novel sequence containing 2,226 paralogous gene copies, 115 of which are predicted to be protein coding. The newly completed regions include all centromeric satellite arrays and the short arms of all five acrocentric chromosomes, unlocking these complex regions of the genome to variational and functional studies for the first time.},

  abstract = {Cigarette smoking causes lung inflammation and tissue damage. Lung fibroblasts play a major role in tissue repair. Previous studies have reported smoking-associated changes in fibroblast responses and methylation patterns. Our aim was to identify the effect of current smoking on miRNA expression in primary lung fibroblasts. Small RNA sequencing was performed on lung fibroblasts from nine current and six ex-smokers with normal lung function. MiR-335-5p and miR-335-3p were significantly downregulated in lung fibroblasts from current compared to ex-smokers (false discovery rate (FDR) {$<$}0.05). Differential miR-335-5p expression was validated with RT-qPCR (p-value = 0.01). The results were validated in lung tissue from current and ex-smokers and in bronchial biopsies from non-diseased smokers and never-smokers (p-value {$<$}0.05). The methylation pattern of the miR-335 host gene, determined by methylation-specific qPCR, did not differ between current and ex-smokers. To obtain insights into the genes regulated by miR-335-5p in fibroblasts, we overlapped all proven miR-335-5p targets with our previously published miRNA targetome data in lung fibroblasts. This revealed Rb1, CARF, and SGK3 as likely targets of miR-335-5p in lung fibroblasts. Our study indicates that miR-335-5p downregulation due to current smoking may affect its function in lung fibroblasts by targeting Rb1, CARF and SGK3.},

  abstract = {The accurate quantification of changes in the abundance of proteins is one of the main applications of proteomics. The maintenance of accuracy can be affected by bias and error that can occur at many points in the experimental process, and normalization strategies are crucial to attempt to overcome this bias and return the sample to its regular biological condition, or normal state. Much work has been published on performing normalization on data post-acquisition with many algorithms and statistical processes available. However, there are many other sources of bias that can occur during experimental design and sample handling that are currently unaddressed. This article aims to cast light on the potential sources of bias and where normalization could be applied to return the sample to its normal state. Throughout we suggest solutions where possible but, in some cases, solutions are not available. Thus, we see this article as a starting point for discussion of the definition of and the issues surrounding the concept of normalization as it applies to the proteomic analysis of biological samples. Specifically, we discuss a wide range of different normalization techniques that can occur at each stage of the sample preparation and analysis process.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease and is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Chronic inflammation and repair processes in the small airways are characteristic of COPD. Despite extensive efforts from researchers and industry, there is still no cure for COPD, hence an urgent need for new therapeutic alternatives. MicroRNAs are such an option; they are small noncoding RNAs involved in gene regulation. Their importance has been shown with respect to maintaining the balance between health and disease. Although previous reviews have discussed the expression of microRNAs related to lung disease, a detailed discussion regarding the function of differential miRNA expression in the pathogenesis of COPD is lacking.             In this review we link the expression of microRNAs to different features of COPD and explain their importance in the pathogenesis of this disease. We further discuss their potential to contribute to the development of future therapeutic strategies.},

Here we characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of self-reactive CD8               +               T cells in a mouse model of protracted central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity and compare it to populations of CNS-resident memory CD8               +               T cells emerging from acute viral infection. We find that autoimmune CD8               +               T cells persisting at sites of self-antigen exhibit characteristic transcriptional regulation together with distinct epigenetic remodeling. This self-reactive CD8               +               T cell fate depends on the transcriptional regulation by the DNA-binding HMG-box protein TOX which remodels more than 400 genomic regions including loci such as               Tcf7               , which is central to stemness of CD8               +               T cells. Continuous exposure to CNS self-antigen sustains TOX levels in self-reactive CD8               +               T cells, whereas genetic ablation of TOX in CD8               +               T cells results in shortened persistence of self-reactive CD8               +               T cells in the inflamed CNS. Our study establishes and characterizes the genetic differentiation program enabling chronic T cell-driven immunopathology in CNS autoimmunity.},

Viegi  Number 5 in this Series  This section is written to provide guidance in interpreting pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to medical directors of hospital-based laboratories that perform PFTs, and physicians who are responsible for interpreting the results of PFTs most commonly ordered for clinical purposes. Specifically, this section addresses the interpretation of spirometry, bronchodilator response, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity ( D L,CO) and lung volumes. The sources of variation in lung function testing and technical aspects of spirometry, lung volume measurements and D L,CO measurement have been considered in other documents published in this series of Task Force reports 1–4 and in the American Thoracic Society (ATS) interpretative strategies document 5. An interpretation begins with a review and comment on test quality. Tests that are less than optimal may still contain useful information, but interpreters should identify the problems and the direction and magnitude of the potential errors. Omitting the quality review and relying only on numerical results for clinical decision making is a common mistake, which is more easily made by those who are dependent upon computer interpretations. Once quality has been assured, the next steps involve a series of comparisons 6 that include comparisons of test results with reference values based on healthy subjects 5, comparisons with known disease or abnormal physiological patterns ( i.e. obstruction and restriction), and comparisons with self, a rather formal term for evaluating change in an individual patient. A final step in the lung function report is to answer the clinical question that prompted the test. Poor choices made during these preparatory steps increase the risk of misclassification, i.e. a falsely negative or falsely positive interpretation for a lung function abnormality or a change …},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               It is important to understand the composition of cell type and its proportion in intact tissues, as changes in certain cell types are the underlying cause of disease in humans. Although compositions of cell type and ratios can be obtained by single-cell sequencing, single-cell sequencing is currently expensive and cannot be applied in clinical studies involving a large number of subjects. Therefore, it is useful to apply the bulk RNA-Seq dataset and the single-cell RNA dataset to deconvolute and obtain the cell type composition in the tissue.                                         Results               By analyzing the existing cell population prediction methods, we found that most of the existing methods need the cell-type-specific gene expression profile as the input of the signature matrix. However, in real applications, it is not always possible to find an available signature matrix. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel method, named DCap, to predict cell abundance. DCap is a deconvolution method based on non-negative least squares. DCap considers the weight resulting from measurement noise of bulk RNA-seq and calculation error of single-cell RNA-seq data, during the calculation process of non-negative least squares and performs the weighted iterative calculation based on least squares. By weighting the bulk tissue gene expression matrix and single-cell gene expression matrix, DCap minimizes the measurement error of bulk RNA-Seq and also reduces errors resulting from differences in the number of expressed genes in the same type of cells in different samples. Evaluation test shows that DCap performs better in cell type abundance prediction than existing methods.                                         Conclusion               DCap solves the deconvolution problem using weighted non-negative least squares to predict cell type abundance in tissues. DCap has better prediction results and does not need to prepare a signature matrix that gives the cell-type-specific gene expression profile in advance. By using DCap, we can better study the changes in cell proportion in diseased tissues and provide more information on the follow-up treatment of diseases.},

  abstract = {Significance             MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression and have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes. Using small RNA sequencing, we identified microRNA 4423 (miR-4423) as a primate-specific microRNA whose expression is largely restricted to airway epithelium and which functions as a regulator of airway epithelium differentiation and a repressor of lung carcinogenesis. Understanding miR-4423’s role in airway development may provide insights into primate-specific aspects of airway biology and the evolution of primate-specific tumor suppressors. Moreover, this study opens the possibility that microRNAs might be useful for the early detection of lung cancer in the proximal airway and that miR-4423 mimetics might also be used as therapeutic agents to specifically target lung cancer.           ,              Smoking is a significant risk factor for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although microRNAs are regulators of many airway gene-expression changes induced by smoking, their role in modulating changes associated with lung cancer in these cells remains unknown. Here, we use next-generation sequencing of small RNAs in the airway to identify microRNA 4423 (miR-4423) as a primate-specific microRNA associated with lung cancer and expressed primarily in mucociliary epithelium. The endogenous expression of miR-4423 increases as bronchial epithelial cells undergo differentiation into mucociliary epithelium in vitro, and its overexpression during this process causes an increase in the number of ciliated cells. Furthermore, expression of miR-4423 is reduced in most lung tumors and in cytologically normal epithelium of the mainstem bronchus of smokers with lung cancer. In addition, ectopic expression of miR-4423 in a subset of lung cancer cell lines reduces their anchorage-independent growth and significantly decreases the size of the tumors formed in a mouse xenograft model. Consistent with these phenotypes, overexpression of miR-4423 induces a differentiated-like pattern of airway epithelium gene expression and reverses the expression of many genes that are altered in lung cancer. Together, our results indicate that miR-4423 is a regulator of airway epithelium differentiation and that the abrogation of its function contributes to lung carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               As the most stable and experimentally accessible epigenetic mark, DNA methylation is of great interest to the research community. The landscape of DNA methylation across tissues, through development and in disease pathogenesis is not yet well characterized. Thus there is a need for rapid and cost effective methods for assessing genome-wide levels of DNA methylation. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a very useful addition to the available methods for DNA methylation analysis but its complex design, incorporating two different assay methods, requires careful consideration. Accordingly, several normalization schemes have been published. We have taken advantage of known DNA methylation patterns associated with genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in addition to the performance of SNP genotyping assays present on the array, to derive three independent metrics which we use to test alternative schemes of correction and normalization. These metrics also have potential utility as quality scores for datasets.                                         Results                                The standard index of DNA methylation at any specific CpG site is                 β                 =                 M                 /(                 M                 +                 U                 + 100) where M and U are methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, respectively. Betas (                 β                 s) calculated from raw signal intensities (the default GenomeStudio behavior) perform well, but using 11 methylomic datasets we demonstrate that quantile normalization methods produce marked improvement, even in highly consistent data, by all three metrics. The commonly used procedure of normalizing betas is inferior to the separate normalization of M and U, and it is also advantageous to normalize Type I and Type II assays separately. More elaborate manipulation of quantiles proves to be counterproductive.                                                        Conclusions               Careful selection of preprocessing steps can minimize variance and thus improve statistical power, especially for the detection of the small absolute DNA methylation changes likely associated with complex disease phenotypes. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called wateRmelon, downloadable from bioConductor, compatible with the existing methylumi, minfi and IMA packages, that allows others to utilize the same normalization methods and data quality tests on 450K data.},

Of the 232 known mammalian miRNAs, we found that 161 overlap with 123 defined transcription units (TUs). We identified miRNAs within introns of 90 protein-coding genes with a broad spectrum of molecular functions, and in both introns and exons of 66 mRNA-like noncoding RNAs (mlncRNAs). In addition, novel families of miRNAs based on host gene identity were identified. The transcription patterns of all miRNA host genes were curated from a variety of sources illustrating spatial, temporal, and physiological regulation of miRNA expression. These findings strongly suggest that miRNAs are transcribed in parallel with their host transcripts, and that the two different transcription classes of miRNAs (`exonic' and `intronic') identified here may require slightly different mechanisms of biogenesis.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background and Objective: The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend using a combination of spirometry, symptoms and exacerbation history to classify patients into 4 categories (A, B, C, D) to guide treatment decisions along with a stepwise increase in therapy. Our objectives were to identify the GOLD stage of patients in respiratory outpatient clinics and assess how treatment compares to guideline recommendations. Methods: This was a point prevalence study using a convenience sample of 500 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from a single tertiary care outpatient respiratory clinic. Results: Patients’ GOLD classification was determined based on symptoms (modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] dyspnea scale, COPD Assessment Test [CAT]), spirometry and self-reported exacerbation history. A total of 8.2\% of patients were in the GOLD group A, 28.3\% in group B, 4.2\% in group C and 59.2\% in group D. Conclusions: In this 500 patient point prevalence study we report a low proportion of patients in GOLD group C and a high level of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/ long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and triple therapy use throughout all GOLD categories. Clinical Implications: The GOLD guidelines have attempted to provide direction to practitioners by grouping patients into 4 groups based on symptoms and exacerbations however, the low prevalence of GOLD group C may indicate that not all of these groupings are clinically relevant. Future research is needed to better identify clinically relevant phenotypes that predict benefit from ICS and methods to promote guideline concordant management in COPD.},

  abstract = {In obese people, the presence of adipose tissue around the rib cage and abdomen and in the visceral cavity loads the chest wall and reduces functional residual capacity (FRC). The reduction in FRC and in expiratory reserve volume is detectable, even at a modest increase in weight. However, obesity has little direct effect on airway caliber. Spirometric variables decrease in proportion to lung volumes, but are rarely below the normal range, even in the extremely obese, while reductions in expiratory flows and increases in airway resistance are largely normalized by adjusting for lung volumes. Nevertheless, the reduction in FRC has consequences for other aspects of lung function. A low FRC increases the risk of both expiratory flow limitation and airway closure. Marked reductions in expiratory reserve volume may lead to abnormalities in ventilation distribution, with closure of airways in the dependent zones of the lung and ventilation perfusion inequalities. Greater airway closure during tidal breathing is associated with lower arterial oxygen saturation in some subjects, even though lung CO-diffusing capacity is normal or increased in the obese. Bronchoconstriction has the potential to enhance the effects of obesity on airway closure and thus on ventilation distribution. Thus obesity has effects on lung function that can reduce respiratory well-being, even in the absence of specific respiratory disease, and may also exaggerate the effects of existing airway disease.},

  abstract = {The development of therapeutic approaches to treat lung disease requires an understanding of both the normal and disease physiology of the lung. Although traditional experimental approaches only address either organ or cellular physiology, the use of lung slice preparations provides a unique approach to investigate integrated physiology that links the cellular and organ responses. Living lung slices are robust and can be prepared from a variety of species, including humans, and they retain many aspects of the cellular and structural organization of the lung. Functional portions of intrapulmonary airways, arterioles and veins are present within the alveoli parenchyma. The dynamics of macroscopic changes of contraction and relaxation associated with the airways and vessels are readily observed with conventional low-magnification microscopy. The microscopic changes associated with cellular events, that determine the macroscopic responses, can be observed with confocal or two-photon microscopy. To investigate disease processes, lung slices can either be prepared from animal models of disease or animals exposed to disease invoking conditions. Alternatively, the lung slices themselves can be experimentally manipulated. Because of the ability to observe changes in cell physiology and how these responses manifest themselves at the level of the organ, lung slices have become a standard tool for the investigation of lung disease.},

  abstract = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) regulate fundamental cellular responses such as proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility, and adhesion. Viable gene-targeted mice lacking the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ were generated. We show that PI3Kγ controls thymocyte survival and activation of mature T cells but has no role in the development or function of B cells. PI3Kγ-deficient neutrophils exhibited severe defects in migration and respiratory burst in response to heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and chemotactic agents. PI3Kγ links GPCR stimulation to the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and the activation of protein kinase B, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Thus, PI3Kγ regulates thymocyte development, T cell activation, neutrophil migration, and the oxidative burst.},

  abstract = {We have shown that smoking impacts bronchial airway gene expression and that heterogeneity in this response associates with smoking-related disease risk. In this study, we sought to determine whether microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in regulating the airway gene expression response to smoking. We examined whole-genome miRNA and mRNA expression in bronchial airway epithelium from current and never smokers (               n               = 20) and found 28 miRNAs to be differentially expressed (               P               {$<$} 0.05) with the majority being down-regulated in smokers. We further identified a number of mRNAs whose expression level is highly inversely correlated with miRNA expression in vivo. Many of these mRNAs contain potential binding sites for the differentially expressed miRNAs in their 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and are themselves affected by smoking. We found that either increasing or decreasing the levels of mir-218 (a miRNA that is strongly affected by smoking) in both primary bronchial epithelial cells and H1299 cells was sufficient to cause a corresponding decrease or increase in the expression of predicted mir-218 mRNA targets, respectively. Further, mir-218 expression is reduced in primary bronchial epithelium exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), and alteration of mir-218 levels in these cells diminishes the induction of the predicted mir-218 target MAFG in response to CSC. These data indicate that mir-218 levels modulate the airway epithelial gene expression response to cigarette smoke and support a role for miRNAs in regulating host response to environmental toxins.},

  abstract = {Elevated immune responses and the higher incidence of autoimmune diseases in female (compared to male) humans and animals have been known for a long time. However, the scientific interest in this interrelationship has been limited both amongst immunologists and endocrinologists. It is mainly in the last ten years that investigations in this area have been intensifying. A number of fairly recent review articles confirm the increased interest in various aspects of this “interdiscipline” [1–4]. In the present paper we should like to make a new assessment of the state of knowledge. We shall firstly discuss heteroimmune response differences between males and females in humans, rodents and birds and then the roles of gender and sex hormones in autoimmune disease in various species. The general conclusions are the following. Gender and sex hormones have a clear effect on various hetero- and auto-immune responses but the mechanisms of action are still unknown; starting from sex hormones, steroids can be devised which have favourable effects on immune processes but lack undesirable hormonal effects; such hormonomimetics should be, in principle, applicable for the treatment of autoimmune disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic condition characterised by progressive airflow limitation that is at most partially reversible. Despite the lack of reversibility patients often report symptomatic improvement with short-acting beta-2 bronchodilator medication. Short-acting beta-2 bronchodilators are used in the management of both stable and acute exacerbations of COPD. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and assess the adverse effects of regular treatment with short-acting beta-2 agonists bronchodilators in patients with stable COPD. SEARCH STRATEGY: A search was carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group database. In addition, the reference lists of review articles and the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved in full text were searched for other potentially relevant citations. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs of at least one week in duration comparing treatment with inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists with placebo in patients with stable COPD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and study quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. Where further or missing data was required, authors of studies were contacted. The data was analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager 4.1. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review. All studies used a crossover design and were of high quality. Spirometry performed at the end of the study period and after the administration of treatment (post-bronchodilator) showed a slight but significant increase in FEV1 and FVC when compared to placebo (WMD=0.14 L; 95\%CI=0.04,0.25 \& WMD=0.30 L; 95\%CI=0.02,0.58, respectively). In addition, both morning and evening PEFR were significantly better during active treatment than during placebo (WMD=29.17 L/min; 95\%CI=0.25,58.09 \& WMD=36.75 L/min; 95\%CI=2.56,70.94, respectively). A significant improvement in daily breathlessness score was observed during treatment with beta-2 agonist when compared to placebo (SMD=1.33; 95\%CI=1.0,1.65). The risk of dropping out of the study (treatment failure) when on treatment with placebo was almost twice that of patients on treatment with beta-2 agonists (RR=0.49; 95\%CI=0.33,0.73). Patients preferred beta-2 agonists almost 10 times more frequently to placebo (OR=9.04; 95\%CI=4.64,17.61). One study that used a validated questionnaire for 'quality of life' assessment, found highly significant improvements in the scores for dyspnoea (p=0.003) and fatigue (p=0.0003) during treatment with salbutamol. No studies reported serious side effects during treatment with inhaled beta-agonists. However, none of the studies were of sufficient length or size in order to allow any meaningful information on long-term occurrence of side effects. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-acting beta-2 agonists on a regular basis for at least seven days in stable COPD is associated with improvements in post bronchodilator lung function and a decrease in breathlessness. Patients are far more likely to prefer treatment with beta-2 agonists than placebo, and less likely to drop out from such treatment. None of the studies included in this review reported sufficient data or were of sufficient length or size in order to provide reliable information on adverse effects. Therefore large scale, parallel, longer term studies would be needed to investigate the effect of treatment with regular inhaled beta-2 agonists on mortality, disease progression and side effects. Newer, long acting bronchodilators (including long-acting beta-2 agonists) are currently available and they may be more practical and/or effective in these patients. However, this review indicates that treatment with these older, inexpensive drugs is beneficial in patients with COPD.},

Using high-density gene expression arrays, we describe genes that are normally expressed in a subset of human airway epithelial cells obtained at bronchoscopy (the airway transcriptome), define how cigarette smoking alters the transcriptome, and detail the effects of variables, such as cumulative exposure, age, sex, and race, on cigarette smoke-induced changes in gene expression. We also determine which changes in gene expression are and are not reversible when smoking is discontinued. The persistent altered expression of a subset of genes in former smokers may explain the risk these individuals have for developing lung cancer long after they have discontinued smoking. The use of gene expression profiling to explore the normal biology of a specific subset of cells within a complex organ across a broad spectrum of healthy individuals and to define the reversible and irreversible genetic effects of cigarette smoke on human airway epithelial cells has not been previously reported.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and a significant cause of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Prior studies have demonstrated that smoking creates a field of molecular injury throughout the airway epithelium exposed to cigarette smoke. We have previously characterized gene expression in the bronchial epithelium of never smokers and identified the gene expression changes that occur in the mainstem bronchus in response to smoking. In this study, we explored relationships in whole-genome gene expression between extrathorcic (buccal and nasal) and intrathoracic (bronchial) epithelium in healthy current and never smokers.                                         Results               Using genes that have been previously defined as being expressed in the bronchial airway of never smokers (the "normal airway transcriptome"), we found that bronchial and nasal epithelium from non-smokers were most similar in gene expression when compared to other epithelial and nonepithelial tissues, with several antioxidant, detoxification, and structural genes being highly expressed in both the bronchus and nose. Principle component analysis of previously defined smoking-induced genes from the bronchus suggested that smoking had a similar effect on gene expression in nasal epithelium. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that this set of genes was also highly enriched among the genes most altered by smoking in both nasal and buccal epithelial samples. The expression of several detoxification genes was commonly altered by smoking in all three respiratory epithelial tissues, suggesting a common airway-wide response to tobacco exposure.                                         Conclusion               Our findings support a relationship between gene expression in extra- and intrathoracic airway epithelial cells and extend the concept of a smoking-induced field of injury to epithelial cells that line the mouth and nose. This relationship could potentially be utilized to develop a non-invasive biomarker for tobacco exposure as well as a non-invasive screening or diagnostic tool providing information about individual susceptibility to smoking-induced lung diseases.},

We demonstrate that existing algorithms for identifying DMRs either fail to consistently control false positive rates (comb-p and DMRcate), suffer from low power (bumphunter) or lack modeling flexibility (seqlm). We introduce a new method, dmrff, that overcomes these shortcomings and can additionally be used to meta-analyze multiple datasets. When applied to investigate associations of age in multiple datasets, dmrff identifies novel DMRs near genes previously linked to age. An R implementation is available on Github (http://github.com/perishky/dmrff).},

FVC and FEV1 decline with age, while volumes and capacities, such as RV and FRC, increase. TLC, VC, RV, FVC and FEV1 are affected by height, since they are proportional to body size. This means that a tall individual will experience greater decrease in lung volumes as they get older. Some variables, such as FRC and ERV, decline exponentially with an increase in weight, to the extent that tidal volume in morbidly obese patients can be close to that of RV. Men have longer airways than women, causing greater specific resistance in the respiratory tract. The increased work of breathing to increase ventilation among women means that their consumption of oxygen is higher than men under similar conditions of physical intensity. Lung volumes are higher when the subject is standing than in other positions. DLCO is significantly higher in supine positions than in sitting or standing positions, but the difference between sitting and standing positions is not significant. Anthropometric characteristics are insufficient to explain differences in lung function between different ethnic groups, underlining the importance of considering other factors in addition to the conventional anthropometric measurements.},

  abstract = {In this research, Bayesian network is proposed as the model to construct gene regulatory networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle gene expression dataset and Escherichia coli dataset due to its capability of handling microarray datasets with missing values. The goal of this research is to study and to understand the framework of the Bayesian networks, and then to construct gene regulatory networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle gene expression dataset and Escherichia coli dataset by developing Bayesian networks using hill-climbing algorithm and Efron’s bootstrap approach and then the performance of the constructed gene networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are evaluated and are compared with the previously constructed sub-networks by Dejori [14]. At the end of this research, the gene networks constructed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae not only have achieved high True Positive Rate (more than 90\%), but the networks constructed also have discovered more potential interactions between genes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the performance of the gene regulatory networks constructed using Bayesian networks in this research is proved to be better because it can reveal more gene relationships. 				 				Dalam penyelidikan ini, Bayesian network adalah dicadangkan sebagai model untuk membina gene regulatory networks dari kitar sel S. cerevisiae set data disebabkan keupayaannya untuk mengendali set data microarray yang mempunyai nilai-nilai yang hilang. Tujuan penyelidikan ini adalah untuk mempelajari dan memahami rekabentuk untuk Bayesian network, dan kemudian untuk membina gene regulatory networks dari data Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle gene expression dan data Escherichia coli dengan membina model Bayesian networks dengan menggunakan algoritma hill-climbing serta Efron’s bootstrap approach dan gene networks yang dibina untuk Saccharomyces cerevisiae dibandingkan dengan sub-networks yang dibina oleh Dejori [14]. Pada akhir kajian ini, gene networks yang dibina untuk Saccharomyces cerevisiae bukan sahaja telah mencapai True Positive Rate yang tinggi (lebih dari 90\%), tetapi gene networks yang dibina juga telah menemui lebih banyak interaksi berpotensi antara gen. Oleh kerana itu, dapat disimpulkan bahawa prestasi gene networks yang dibina menggunakan Bayesian network dalam kajian ini adalah terbukti lebih baik kerana ia boleh mendedahkan lebih banyak hubungan antara gen.},

  abstract = {Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) is a common feature in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is associated with worse prognosis and quality of life. This study aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA)–mRNA regulatory networks underlying CMH.             The expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA in bronchial biopsies from 63 COPD patients were associated with CMH using linear regression. Potential mRNA targets of each CMH-associated miRNA were identified using Pearson correlations. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and STRING (search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins) analysis were used to identify key genes and pathways.                            20 miRNAs and 539 mRNAs were differentially expressed with CMH in COPD. The expression of 10 miRNAs was significantly correlated with the expression of one or more mRNAs. Of these, miR-134-5p, miR-146a-5p and the let-7 family had the highest representation of CMH-associated mRNAs among their negatively correlated predicted targets.               KRAS               and               EDN1               were identified as key regulators of CMH and were negatively correlated predicted targets of miR-134-5p and let-7a-5p, let-7d-5p, and let-7f-5p, respectively. GSEA suggested involvement of               MUC5AC               -related genes and several other relevant gene sets in CMH. The lower expression of miR-134-5p was confirmed in primary airway fibroblasts from COPD patients with CMH.                                         We identified miR-134-5p, miR-146a-5p and let-7 family, along with their potential target genes including               KRAS               and               EDN1               , as potential key miRNA–mRNA networks regulating CMH in COPD.},

  abstract = {Mucins are important components that exert a variety of functions in cell-cell interaction, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, and airways protection. In the conducting airways of the lungs, mucins are the major contributor to the viscoelastic property of mucous secretion, which is the major barrier to trapping inhaled microbial organism, particulates, and oxidative pollutants. The homeostasis of mucin production is an important feature in conducting airways for the maintenance of mucociliary function. Aberrant mucin secretion and accumulation in airway lumen are clinical hallmarks associated with various lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, emphysema, and lung cancer. Among 20 known mucin genes identified, 11 of them have been verified at either the mRNA and/or protein level in airways. The regulation of mucin genes is complicated, as are the mediators and signaling pathways. This review summarizes the current view on the mediators, the signaling pathways, and the transcriptional units that are involved in the regulation of airway mucin gene expression. In addition, we also point out essential features of epigenetic mechanisms for the regulation of these genes.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is induced by cigarette smoking and characterized by inflammation of airway tissue. Since smokers with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer than those without, we hypothesized that they carry more mutations in affected tissue. We called somatic mutations in airway brush samples from medium-coverage whole genome sequencing data from healthy never and ex-smokers (n\,=\,8), as well as from ex-smokers with variable degrees of COPD (n\,=\,4). Owing to the limited concordance of resulting calls between the applied tools we built a consensus, a strategy that was validated with high accuracy for cancer data. However, consensus calls showed little promise of representing true positives due to low mappability of corresponding sequence reads and high overlap with positions harbouring known genetic polymorphisms. A targeted re-sequencing approach suggested that only few mutations would survive stringent verification testing and that our data did not allow the inference of any difference in the mutational load of bronchial brush samples between former smoking COPD cases and controls. High polyclonality in airway brush samples renders medium-depth sequencing insufficient to provide the resolution to detect somatic mutations. Deep sequencing data of airway biopsies are needed to tackle the question.},

  abstract = {Pathological features of both asthma and COPD coexist in some patients and this is termed asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). ACO is heterogeneous and patients exhibit various combinations of asthma and COPD features, making it difficult to characterise the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. There are no controlled studies that define effective therapies for ACO, which arises from the lack of international consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for ACO, as well as scant               in vitro               and               in vivo               data. There remain unmet needs for experimental models of ACO that accurately recapitulate the hallmark features of ACO in patients. The development and interrogation of such models will identify underlying disease-causing mechanisms, as well as enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and providing a platform for assessing new ACO therapies. Here, we review the current understanding of the clinical features of ACO and highlight the approaches that are best suited for developing representative experimental models of ACO.},

After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure               1               . Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold               2               , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

  abstract = {As knowledge of airways disease has grown, it has become apparent that neither chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) nor asthma is a simple, easily defined disease. In the past, treatment options for both diseases were limited; thus, there was less need to define subgroups. As treatment options have grown, so has our need to predict who will respond to new drugs. To date, identifying subgroups has been largely reported by detailed clinical characterisation or differences in pathobiology. These subgroups are commonly called “phenotypes”; however, the problem of defining what constitutes a phenotype, whether this should include comorbid diseases and how to handle changes over time has led to the term being used loosely.             In this review, we describe subgroups of COPD and asthma patients whose clinical characteristics we believe have therapeutic or major prognostic implications specific to the lung, and whether these subgroups are constant over time. Finally, we will discuss whether the subgroups we describe are common to both asthma and COPD, and give some examples of how treatment might be tailored in patients where the subgroup is clear, but the label of asthma or COPD is not.},

The results of the experiments reveal that nonlinear tech- niques perform well on selected artificial tasks, but that this strong performance does not necessarily extend to real-world tasks. The paper explains these results by identi- fying weaknesses of current nonlinear techniques, and suggests how the performance of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques may be improved.},

These can undergo site- and cell-specific metabolism to cytotoxic intermediates. Metabolism of naphthalene and Clara cell cytotoxicity have been extensively studied in male animals. To address whether male and female mice are equally susceptible to naphthalene, mice were injected with naphthalene, and lungs were examined 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h after treatment. By analysis of acute injury using differential permeability to fluorescent nuclear dyes and high-resolution histopathology, injury in female mice was found to be more extensive, occur earlier, and include permeable cells in proximal airways, including airway bifurcations. HPLC analysis of the products of cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism in microdissected airways indicated that although both genders produced a predominance of products from CYP2F2, female mice produced more naphthalene dihydrodiol in distal airways, the primary sites of injury. We conclude that there are clear gender differences in susceptibility to naphthalene-induced injury and that differences in metabolism of naphthalene may play a role in elevated susceptibility in female mice.},

  abstract = {Approximately 40\% of asthmatics experience remission of asthma symptoms. A better understanding of biological pathways leading to asthma remission may provide insight into new therapeutic targets for asthma. As an important mechanism of gene regulation, investigation of DNA methylation provides a promising approach. Our objective was to identify differences in epigenome wide DNA methylation levels in bronchial biopsies between subjects with asthma remission and subjects with persistent asthma or healthy controls.             We analysed differential DNA methylation in bronchial biopsies from 26 subjects with persistent asthma, 39 remission subjects and 70 healthy controls, using the limma package. The comb-p tool was used to identify differentially methylated regions. DNA methylation of CpG-sites was associated to expression of nearby genes from the same biopsies to understand function.                            Four CpG-sites and 42 regions were differentially methylated between persistent asthma and remission. DNA methylation at two sites was correlated               i               n               cis               with gene expression at               ACKR2               and               DGKQ               . Between remission subjects and healthy controls 1163 CpG-sites and 328 regions were differentially methylated. DNA methylation was associated with expression of a set of genes expressed in ciliated epithelium.                                         CpGs differentially methylated between remission and persistent asthma identify genetic loci associated with resolution of inflammation and airway responsiveness. Despite the absence of symptoms, remission subjects have a DNA methylation profile that is distinct from that of healthy controls, partly due to changes in cellular composition, with a higher gene expression signal related to ciliated epithelium in remission               versus               healthy controls.},

The greater immune responsiveness in females is also evident in their increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. However, a clear understanding of the myriad of effects that sex hormones have on the immune system is lacking. Studies in normal mice show that estrogen treatment induces polyclonal B cell activation with increased expression of autoantibodies characteristic of autoimmune diseases. Several mechanisms appear to contribute to the break in tolerance and the increase in plasma cell activity including a reduction of the mass of the bone marrow and the thymus, the emergence of sites of extrameduallary hematopoiesis and altered susceptibility of B cells to cell death. In addition, sex hormone levels in both humans and experimental models correlated with the activity of their cytokine-secreting cells indicating that sex hormones influence the cytokine milieu and suggesting that altered sex hormonal levels in autoimmune patients contribute to the skewed cytokine milieu characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While sex hormones alone do not cause autoimmune disease, abnormal hormone levels may provide the stage for other factors (genetic, infectious) to trigger disease. Understanding the physiology of the interaction between sex hormones and immune function and its potential pathological consequences may provide insight into the autoimmune diseases and new directions for their treatment.},

  abstract = {Summary Study objectives: The aim of this analysis was to understand the implications of the GOLD 2011 multidimensional system for the assessment and management of COPD, using data from a real- world observational study. Methods: Data were drawn from the Adelphi Respiratory Disease Specific Programme, a cross- sectional survey of consulting patients in five European countries and in the US undertaken be- tween June and September 2011. Patients were classified using both the GOLD 2010 and revised GOLD 2011 criteria, and profiled with regards to demographics, disease characteristics and treatment patterns. Results: Information on 3813 COPD patients was collected. Disease characteristics showed a general tendency to worsen in parallel with worsening of symptoms. When comparing dual versus single risk criteria, the inclusion of exacerbation history resulted in an increase in the number of patients in high risk groups. The highest proportions of patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were in group D. However, a considerable proportion of patients in low risk groups were receiving ICS/long-acting b2 agonists. Conclusions: Our analysis confirmed the relationship between higher symptomatic burden, increased airflow limitation and exacerbation, and further illustrated the importance of including exacerbation history in the assessment of COPD to identify patients at high risk. As based on data from current clinical practice, this study also highlighted the frequent and potentially inappropriate use of ICS and bronchodilators in patients at low risk of experiencing exacerbations.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disabling condition associated with progressive airflow limitation that is largely irreversible, with symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum production. In The Netherlands, COPD tends to be underpresented to physicians, underdiagnosed and undertreated by healthcare professionals, and poorly recognized among the general population. Improving the diagnosis and management of COPD in this country may require raised awareness of the impact of the disease on society. This may be achieved by providing detailed information on the burden of COPD on the patient, healthcare system and the economy. This information has now become available from Confronting COPD in North America and Europe, the first international survey to quantify the country-specific impact of the disease. An economic analysis of the results of the Dutch survey revealed the high cost of COPD to the healthcare system and society, with direct costs estimated at Euro 614 per patient Indirect costs amounted to Euro 410, bringing the annual per patient cost of COPD to Euro 1024. Around 50\% of the cost of COPD to the healthcare system was for prescription medication, including symptomatic medication and treatment for underlying airway inflammation. This contributed to effective symptom control in many patients, as shown by the low utilization of unscheduled healthcare (inpatient hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or contacts with healthcare professionals). However, the survey suggested that there was scope for improvement in the understanding of the origin and consequences of this disease among the general public, and the way COPD is managed by healthcare professionals, in order to increase the proportion of patients who are diagnosed with COPD and treated in accordance with management guidelines. In addition, smoking cessation intervention at the early stages of the disease could help to reduce the high costs associated with severe COPD in this country.},

Through extension of deep learning-based prediction to interresidue orientations in addition to distances, and the development of a constrained optimization by Rosetta, we show that more accurate models can be generated. Results on a set of 18 de novo-designed proteins suggests the proposed method should be directly applicable to current challenges in de novo protein design.           ,              The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the “ideality” of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.},

  abstract = {Summary             Panel count data, in which the observation for each study subject consists of the number of recurrent events between successive examinations, are commonly encountered in industrial reliability testing, medical research and other scientific investigations. We formulate the effects of potentially time-dependent covariates on one or more types of recurrent events through nonhomogeneous Poisson processes with random effects. We employ nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation under arbitrary examination schemes, and develop a simple and stable EM algorithm. We show that the resulting estimators of the regression parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal, with a covariance matrix that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound and can be estimated using profile likelihood. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and analysis of data from a skin cancer clinical trial.},

  abstract = {Cigarette smoke (CS), a highly complex mixture containing more than 4,000 compounds, causes aberrant cell responses leading to tissue damage around the airways and alveoli, which underlies various lung diseases. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides. PDE inhibition induces bronchodilation, reduces the activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells, and the release of various cytokines. Currently, the selective PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast is an approved add-on treatment for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic bronchitis and a history of frequent exacerbations. Additional selective PDE inhibitors are being tested in preclinical and clinical studies. However, the effect of chronic CS exposure on the expression of PDEs is unknown. Using mRNA isolated from nasal and bronchial brushes and lung tissues of never smokers and current smokers, we compared the gene expression of 25 PDE coding genes. Additionally, the expression and distribution of PDE3A and PDE4D in human lung tissues was examined. This study reveals that chronic CS exposure modulates the expression of various PDE members. Thus, CS exposure may change the levels of intracellular cyclic nucleotides and thereby impact the efficiency of PDE-targeted therapies.},
