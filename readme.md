# Zettelkasten project for my PhD
This is a new zettelkasten project, to organize my thoughts on the many papers I read for my PhD. The program I use to take these notes is [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md). Therefore the notes are written in plain text, using Obsidian [markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes), with some [modifications](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts) and [extensions](https://obsidian.md/plugins). It is even possible to include [flashcards](https://github.com/NeuraCache/markdown-flashcards-spaced-repetition).
